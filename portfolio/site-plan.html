            Welcome to my portfolio website! Here, you can explore my skills, projects, and achievements, and learn more about me. I
            created this website to showcase my passion for programming and web development. At the same time, I hope to connect
            with potential employers and collaborators who are interested in innovating in a world where sometimes wonders stop
            surprising and the future becomes the past too quickly. One of my biggest passions is to combine web development with
            mechatronics. I have received training in mechatronics engineering and I am currently training as a developer. When the
            time comes, I plan to merge these technologies and display my creations on this website. I hope you enjoy exploring my
            work and following my journey. Even as I progress, this website will remain a project that accompanies me throughout my
            life. If you want to learn more, there are two pages full of content that you don't want to miss. Join me on this
            exciting journey, and let's collaborate on everything that's yet to come.

        <h3>Full Stack</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome! In the Full Stack section, you can explore my various web application development projects, which showcase my
            expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies. These projects are interactive, responsive, and user-friendly.
            You can delve into each project to see details such as the programming languages, libraries, and frameworks used, along
            with the features implemented and challenges faced during development. Moreover, you can test some of the projects by
            clicking on the provided links. The projects range from simple apps that consume local data through JavaScript and
            display it to users, to more advanced projects that use the Weather API to give you the weather for your city along with
            a five-day forecast. In case you need any information about a specific country, you can find it here. Similarly, if you
            need to classify users, this is the right page for you. From JavaScript, Python, and PHP, to React, Vite, Vue, Laravel,
            and Django, you will find all these technologies here because we never stop learning.

        <h3>Contact Me</h3>
        <p>
            If you are looking for a way to contact me, the Contact section is the most suitable place for that. In that section,
            you will find my professional contact details, such as my LinkedIn, email, and GitHub profiles. I encourage you to
            follow me on these platforms to stay updated with my latest activities and news. I am always interested in new
            opportunities, collaborations, feedback, and suggestions. I also love to share my knowledge and expertise with anyone
            who wants to learn more about programming and web development. I believe that when we share our ideas and insights, we
            can all grow and improve together. In addition to the contact details, you will also find a description of me and the
            institutions that helped train me. At BYU-Idaho, I learned to create a professional website like this. I believe Pathway-Worldwide and BYU-Idaho can help achieve any goals. Funval is a foundation that aims to promote self-sufficiency by developing new skills, such as
            learning to code.
